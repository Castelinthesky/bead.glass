UC Davis is hiring for a [Senior Statistician in the Violence Prevention
Research Program](/jobs-media/ANC\ -\ Statistician\ VPRP\ v3.pdf). It looks like
a very cool data science + social good opportunity, grounded in an
epidemiological approach. There is a more extensive description in [this
PDF](/jobs-media/VPRP\ APPS\ project\ scientist\ JPF00565\ announcement\
final.pdf), as well as an [official listing where you can
apply](https://recruit.ucdavis.edu/apply/JPF00565)!

The D-Lab also seeks graduate students (or potentially other members of the
Berkeley community) for our *Big Data Compute Project*. We currently have a
need for someone *with non-trivial SAS experience* who will support a
collaboration between the D-Lab and SAS corporation, focused on optimizing
financial data analysis workflows for academic research. Interested students
should contact Dav Clark at davclark@berkeley.edu with a CV and description of
relevant experience.
