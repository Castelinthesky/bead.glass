        <h2 class="h3">Research</h2>
        <p>Our team has published quantitative and qualitative analyses
        spanning education, cognitive neuroscience, development communities
        and cyber-security. We can provide comprehensive guidance from
        research ethics to final results and scaling / implementation. We are
        proponents of open science, and will do everything we can to ensure
        you can take your results to the bank.</p>

        <h2 class="h3">Data Analysis</h2>
        <p>Our bread and butter are scientific codes in Python and R. We
        share results using well-documented IPython and Rmarkdown
        notebooks. Have big data? No problem. We can easily accomodate most
        needs with databases or "simple" setups with Apache
        Spark. If things get too big for our hands, we've got great people we
        can subcontract to while ensuring you have an easy-to-use point of
        access.</p>

        <h2 class="h3">Web Infrastructure</h2>
        <p>We've got you covered with well-architected systems using
        contemporary approaches. We've done front-side development with React and
        Elm, and both API- and content-focused back-ends in Python, Ruby, or
        Node.js. We also love static site generation like Jekyll!</p>
