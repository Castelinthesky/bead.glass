title: The first taiji class was a success!
---
The team at Kennedy Kreiger Institute has successfully run the first taiji class
as part of the NIMH-funded [Movement-Based Mindfulness Training for Children with
ADHD: A Feasibility Study](http://www.kennedykrieger.org/research-training/movement-based-mindfulness-training-children-adhd-feasibility-study)!

This was one of the key moments in the study -- would the kids actually take to
the class? I'm happy to report that the kids were highly engaged, and the
parents even got a chance to observe. In just 4 weeks, we'll start our midpoint
assessments and get our first sense of what effects the training might be
having. Stay tuned!
