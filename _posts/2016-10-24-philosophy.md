title: Philosophy of computational social science
---
Sebastian Benthall's most recent [paper](http://cosmosandhistory.org/index.php/journal/article/view/570), 
"Philosophy of Computational Social Science", has been published in the special issue 
of [*Cosmos and History*](http://www.cosmosandhistory.org/index.php/journal), *Foundations of Mind III: Homage to [Walter Freeman III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Jackson_Freeman_III)*.

This paper takes a step back from the empirical work of social measurement to
look at the philosophical foundations of computational social science.
It argues that the role of computational statistics in social science is
defined by intersubjectively verifiable logic, and that this is what gives it
its power.

What is a paper about philsoophy of social science doing in conference proceedings
dedicated to the esoteric field of *consciousness studies*?

That's a good question. One could pose it another way: what is the relationship between logic and consciousness?
